  Explore review titles and texts for insights into customer satisfaction

-  **Calculate derived metrics**  
  Create new columns like `difference_price`, review category bins, and split product types

-  **Transform categorical data**  
  Split and standardize multi-level product categories

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` for data cleaning and wrangling
- `numpy` for numerical transformations
- `matplotlib / seaborn` (optional, for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks / Google Colab for interactive development

---

##  Sample Insights

- Some products had large discount gaps (> â‚¹1,500), yet received average ratings.
- A small number of ratings contained formatting issues (e.g., `'|'`) that were cleaned manually.
- Many product categories were nested (`Electronics|Accessories|Cables`), requiring transformation for proper analysis.
